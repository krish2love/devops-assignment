## Introduction
This repository holds the DevOps assignment. 

## The assignment
As developers of this beautiful service, of course, we need proper CI/CD! We suggest GitLab with GitLab runner since it is what we use in production. You can create a free account at [https://gitlab.com/](https://gitlab.com/). as pubilc repo, group name as "Demo1" and Project name should be "DemoCICD"

There are a couple of requirements:
- [ ] Write a bash script gencsv.sh to generate a file named inputFile whose content looks like:
**      0, 234
        1, 98
        2, 34**
- [ ] Write a gitlab pipeline(.gitlab-ci.yaml) with one stage, run gencsv.sh script and print the output in pipeline.
